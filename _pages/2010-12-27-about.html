<p>I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm studying to become a computer engineer at Universidad de Buenos Aires since 2003, and i'm about to graduate next year (i hope!). Currently I'm working at <a href="http://www.despegar.com/">despegar.com</a>, the main travel agency in latin america, in the search engine marketing team. I am part of the Solr team. In the past I've worked as a Solr Consultant for <a href="http://www.lucidworks.com/">Lucidworks</a>. Before thatÂ I worked 5 years in the Argentinan Government.I have always loved computers, maths, physics and all that kind of nerdy stuff, and now i will write about that!!!</p>
